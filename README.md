### The Game
You own a zoo and you need to keep your animals happy! Traverse across the zoo and discover animal enclosures, such as a polar bear, wolf, or elephant. Each animal is in need, so hook up your spirometer and use it to help by breathing with it. As you improve at your breaths, you will be rewarded with coins which you can use to customize and upgrade your character!

### Tech
This project was made in Unity version 4.11f1, and requires the Cinemachine package. The intent is to port this game to an iPad Pro; you may open this project in the Unity Editor, and then build and run on iOS. This creates an XCode workspace which can be used to port to iPad. Unity also provides build options for most popular operating systems.

### Assets
We used a [Low Poly Asset Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/low-poly-ultimate-pack-54733) for many of our models. We also made our own models using Blender.
